# New-Restaurent-Analysis

Assuming, I am planning to open a restaurant in Philadelphia üçü: Before opening a restaurant one must keep in mind a lot of factors like:

Type of restaurant you want to open
Target Audience
Is there a demand/need for the type of place you are considering
What kind of facilities you want to offer?
Do you want to offer Alcohol? Should you consider getting an alcohol licence ?
Do you want to offer food delivery?
Should you consider opening just a dessert place or a bakery?
Several other factors and questions arise, I have taken some questions and tried to answer them by querying the YELP Database using MySQL-Python(mysqlclient)

"You can use the mysql client to send commands to any mysql server; on a remote computer or your own. The mysql server is used to persist the data and provide a query interface for it (SQL). The mysql clients purpose is to allow you to use that query interface" -Google
